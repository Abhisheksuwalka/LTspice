everytime you want to run the program, you will need to go to the path

-> cd ~/.wine/drive_c/users/crossover/Desktop

then you need to run the program by 
-> ./LTspice.desktop

or what you can do is create a script 

go to 
-> cd ~
then
-> vim RunLTspice.sh
then paste this there / or create your own script  

#!/bin/bash

cd ~/.wine/drive_c/users/crossover/desktop/
./LTspice.desktop

then save it with " :wq "

and every time you run the script using 
-> ./RunLTspice.sh

in terminal
the program is going to open.
thank you.
